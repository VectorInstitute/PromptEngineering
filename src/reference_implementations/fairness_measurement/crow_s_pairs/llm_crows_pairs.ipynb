    "### Stereotypical Bias Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Stereotypical bias analysis involves examining the data and models to identify patterns of bias, and then taking steps to mitigate these biases. This can include techniques such as re-sampling the data to ensure representation of under-represented groups, adjusting the model's decision threshold to reduce false positives or false negatives for certain groups, or using counterfactual analysis to identify how a model's decision would change if certain demographic features were altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of stereotypical bias analysis is to create more fair and equitable models that are less likely to perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination against certain groups of people. By identifying and addressing stereotypical biases, LLMs can be more reliable and inclusive, and better serve diverse populations.\n"

    "### Overview of CrowS-Pairs dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be working with CrowS-Pairs dataset which was introduced in the paper *[CrowS-Pairs: A Challenge Dataset for Measuring Social Biases in Masked Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00133.pdf)*. \n",
    "The dataset consists of 1,508 sentence pairs covering **nine** different types of **biases**, including **race/color, gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance, and socioeconomic status.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sentence pair in the CrowS-Pairs dataset consists of two sentences, where\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first sentence is about a historically disadvantaged group in the United States.\n",
    "2. The second sentence is about a contrasting advantaged group. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first sentence may either demonstrate or violate a stereotype, and the only words that differ between the two sentences are those that identify the group. The authors provide detailed information about each example in the dataset, including the type of bias, the stereotype demonstrated or violated, and the identity of the disadvantaged and advantaged groups. The authors use the CrowS-Pairs dataset to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs in mitigating social biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further *[Stereotyping Norwegian Salmon: An Inventory of Pitfalls in Fairness Benchmark Datasets](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.81.pdf)* found significant issues with noise and reliability of the data in CrowS-Pairs. The problems are significant enough that CrowS-Pairs may not be a good indicator of the presence of social biases in LMs."

    "### Limitations with CrowS-Pairs dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "While the CrowS-Pairs dataset is a valuable tool for evaluating social biases in masked language models (MLMs), there are some potential limitations and problems associated with this dataset that should be taken into consideration. Here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Limited scope: While the dataset covers nine different types of biases, it is still a relatively limited sample of social biases that may exist in language. There may be additional biases that are not covered by this dataset that could still be present in MLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of intersectionality: The dataset focuses on individual biases but does not account for the potential intersectionality between different types of biases. For example, a sentence may be biased against both women and people of color, but the dataset does not explicitly capture this intersectionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stereotypes as ground truth: The dataset relies on the assumption that certain sentences or phrasings represent stereotypical biases. However, these assumptions may be challenged by different perspectives or cultural norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified scenarios: Like other benchmark datasets, CrowS-Pairs simplifies the scenarios, making them easier to evaluate by models but doesn't reflect the complexity of the real world. In some cases, the scenarios may lack the contextual information necessary for fully understanding the biases being evaluated."

At each generation step this is the number of tokens to select from with relative probabilities associated with their likliehoods. Setting this to 1 is \"Greedy decoding.\" If top_k is set to zero them we exclusively use nucleus sample (i.e. top_p below). top_p: Range: 0.0-1.0, nucleus sampling. At each generation step, the tokens the largest probabilities, adding up to top_p are sampled from relative to their likliehoods. rep_penalty: Range >= 1.0. This attempts to decrease the likelihood of tokens in a generation process if they have been generated before. A value of 1.0 means no penalty and larger values increasingly penalize repeated values. 1.2 has been reported as a good default value. *temperature: Range >=0.0. This value \"sharpens\" or flattens the softmax calculation done to produce probabilties over the vocab. As temperature goes to zero: only the largest probabilities will remain non-zero (approaches greedy decoding). As it approaches infinity, the distribution spreads out evenly over the vocabulary."
