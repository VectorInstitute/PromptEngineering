### Introduction to some NLP metrics

The notebook in this folder focuses on introducing some standard NLP metrics, specifically focusing on metrics common for natural language generation (NLG) tasks.

Tnotebook has a pip install as one of the cells. If you are developing on the JupyterHub or a notebook launched from the cluster, you will have an isolated python environment to install into.

__However__: If you are working on these notebooks locally, be sure to create a virtual environment to install the dependencies into. This can be done, for example, with the command
```
python -m venv <name_of_venv>
```
then
```
source <name_of_venv>/bin/activate
```
