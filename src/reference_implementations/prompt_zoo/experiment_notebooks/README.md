# Experiment Notebooks and MD files

In this folder there are several notebooks for running experiments along with an MD file that walks through how to run a suite of experiments to compare prompt tuning with other forms of tuning such as fine tuning and classifier tuning.

## Running the Notebooks

For instructions on spinning up the notebooks on a GPU in the Vector cluster see the [README.md](../README.md) in the directory above.
