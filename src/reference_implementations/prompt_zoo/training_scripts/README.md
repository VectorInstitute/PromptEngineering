# Training Scripts

This folder houses training scripts to run various experiemnts in `src/reference_implementations/prompt_zoo/`. More details for running each script is given below.

## Large scale experiments

The two larger scale scripts for running experiments are

`run_sst2_sentiment_experiments.sh`

and

`run_sentiment_experiments_gradient_search.sh`

__NOTE__: Before either is run you must activate your environment. If you are using our pre-built environment run

```bash
source /ssd003/projects/aieng/public/prompt_zoo/bin/activate
```

if you are using one you created locally run

```bash
source prompt_torch-env/bin/activate
```

### run_sst2_sentiment_experiments (Hyper-parameter search)

This script orchestrates running a hyper-parameter search for the learning rate on various kinds of prompt-tuning and fine-tuning setups. For more information on how to run each experiment individually see `experiments_notebooks/efficient_tuning_baselines.md`. __REMEMBER__ to activate your environment (as instructed above).

__NOTE__: Before running this script, you need to replace `snajafi` IN THE SCRIPT with your username to ensure that the results are logged to your path. Otherwise you'll receive permission denied errors

This script can be run from the top level directory as

```bash
bash ./src/reference_implementations/prompt_zoo/training_scripts/run_sst2_sentiment_experiments.sh
```

After all of the experiments are complete (or while they are running) you can view the results on tensorboard by running the following. Note that `snajafi` should be replaced with your own username both in the script and below in the tensorboard command.

To view the tensorboard with the training status for all of the submitted jobs:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=/scratch/ssd004/scratch/snajafi/data_temp/torch-prompt/sst2/ --bind_all
```

__NOTE__: You will need to create a tunnel directory to the v instance that you are starting the tensorboard on. This will be one of `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`. It is written in your prompt as `username@v#`... so replace `v` in the command below with the `v#` that you have on your command line

The tensorboard command will finish and stall in the terminal you're working with. Now, in another terminal window, create an ssh tunnel to the port bound by the tensorboard command. We used in the command below from out local computer, where the bound port was, for example, `6006`:

```bash
ssh username@v.vectorinstitute.ai -L 6006:localhost:6006
```

Then visit `https://localhost:6006`.

__Note__: This script can also be used to run a hyper-parameter search for the semeval dataset by changing any mention of `sst2` in the `run_sst2_sentiment_experiments.sh` to `semeval`.

### run_sentiment_experiments_gradient_search

This script orchestrates running gradient-based discrete prompt search for semeval and sst-2. __REMEMBER__ to activate your environment (as instructed above).

__NOTE__: Before running this script, you need to replace `snajafi` IN THE SCRIPT with your username to ensure that the results are logged to your path.

This script should be run from the top level directory as

```bash
bash ./src/reference_implementations/prompt_zoo/training_scripts/run_sentiment_experiments_gradient_search.sh
```

After all of the experiments are complete (or while they are running) you can view the results on tensorboard by running the following. Note that `snajafi` should be replaced with your own username both in the script and below in the tensorboard command.

To view the tensorboard with the training status for all of the submitted jobs:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=/scratch/ssd004/scratch/snajafi/data_temp/torch-prompt/sst2/ --bind_all
```

__NOTE__: You will need to create a tunnel directory to the v instance that you are starting the tensorboard on. This will be one of `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`. It is written in your prompt as `username@v#`... so replace `v` in the command below with the `v#` that you have on your command line

The tensorboard command will finish and stall in the terminal you're working with. Now, in another terminal window, create an ssh tunnel to the port bound by the tensorboard command. We used in the command below from out local computer, where the bound port was, for example, `6006`:

```bash
ssh username@v.vectorinstitute.ai -L 6006:localhost:6006
```

Then visit `https://localhost:6006`.

## Other training scripts

The various other training scripts in this directory are used to run different types of fine-tuning and prompt tuning experiments. Their use is detailed in `experiments_notebooks/efficient_tuning_baselines.md`.
